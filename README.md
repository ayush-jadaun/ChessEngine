Hello, anyone who sees this, this chess engine is under development and training while it works, it needs to be trained on a very large dataset to give very accurate results currently the train was done on 200 games.
Goal is to train it on atleast 10000 games for better and accurate results also the gui is also still under development. 
Anyne who wants to contribute to ths is welcome to do so in helping to train it on more data or make changes in gui.

Thank you.
